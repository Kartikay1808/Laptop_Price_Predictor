 **Laptop_Price_Predictor**
We will make a project for Laptop price prediction. The problem statement is that if any user wants to buy a laptop then our application should be compatible to provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations. Although it looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset we have is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that will drive your interest in developing this project.

**Dataset:**
Dataset is taken from kaggle.

**Streamlit**

Streamlit is an open-source web framework written in Python. It is the fastest way to create data apps and it is widely used by data science practitioners to deploy machine learning models. To work with this it is not important to have any knowledge of frontend languages.

Streamlit contains a wide variety of functionalities, and an in-built function to meet your requirement. It provides you with a plot map, flowcharts, slider, selection box, input field, the concept of caching
